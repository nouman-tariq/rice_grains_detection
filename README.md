# rice_grains_detection

In this project, our objects of interest are grain and typically 10s to 100s of grains which will pass by the sensor each second.  
Our main goal of this project is to isolate a 2D image of each grain from successive 1D scans and send the image of the individual grain off to be evaluated.
